# Thirsty men problem 

Imagine yourself, on a hot day there is a water outage and feeling very thirsty.
You went to the fridge to get some cold water. You were lucky enough and you found a single bottle of water left. 
While you were enjoying this finding and playing with your bottle in the air. Ding dong, somebody ring at the door.

You've got **N** unexpected guests, all of them staring at the bottle in your hand, and suddenly shouting all once "we are thirsty".
You let them in, and all of you gathered in the same room around a table and everybody asked you to drink.

## Now the problem :
The bottle (½ littre) can **only fill 3 cups**. 

To overcome this problem you've ingeniously proposed a solution.
You gave them **each an empty cup** and told them :
>”Look guys I will drink a cup and give you 2 cups of water. But, I'll fill only the first and the last cups put on the table before me. The intermediaries cups will remain empty”

Besides your main rule, you agreed upon the following terms:

- It's only you who can pour water
- The cups can be filled only if all of them are put .
- No timer will be used and the game doesn't have a timeout.
- It's up to you to determine who is the first depositor/winner in case they race to put it.
- Cups put in the same time are considered in sequentiel positions (it’s you who will define the order).
- You are honest :penguin:

The question : **In this context, how would your guests behave**, if you know that they are smart and can cheat :smiling_imp: (but cannot kill each other :skull:). Would there be a good compromise?
